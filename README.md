# High-Resolution-Imaging-Data
The  package includes the data used in Figures 1 to 5 in the paper.
Since the raw data of the ionosonde is quite large and difficult to upload, the echo data of the Es layer after high-resolution imaging processing is packed together and uploaded here. 
All data can be imported and viewed directly by MATLAB with the function of "imagesc".
